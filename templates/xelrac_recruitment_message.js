Dear Bob,

Oh mighty Bob, keeper of the void and ruler of the unseen paths, guide my probes true and bless my jumps with quiet skies. Grant safe passage through your shifting holes, that I may not be cast into the cold embrace of collapse. I offer you wrecks and wreckage, lasers and looted spoils — for all things drift to you in time. Praise be to Bob, the hungry god of wormholes.

Best regards,
Capsuleer
